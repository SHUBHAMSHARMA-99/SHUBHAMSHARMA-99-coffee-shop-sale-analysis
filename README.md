## **Project Description**
The Coffee Maven Sales Dashboard is an interactive and dynamic tool designed to provide deep insights into the sales performance of Coffee Maven, a popular coffee shop chain.

## Business Problem
Coffee Maven is looking to improve its overall sales strategy by gaining deeper insights into customer purchasing patterns, product performance, and store-specific foot fall. The goal is to identify opportunities for growth, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction by tailoring offerings to customer preferences.
